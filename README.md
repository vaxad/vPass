# V-Pass Password Manager

V-Pass is a secure password manager designed for both individual and corporate use. It allows users to save and manage passwords with complete encryption, enables OTP verification for added security, and facilitates team and group password sharing with restricted public viewing links.

## Features

- **Complete Encryption:** All passwords are stored with full encryption to ensure security.
- **OTP Verification:** Two-factor authentication via OTP for enhanced security.
- **Team and Group Management:** Create teams and groups within teams. Invite members via email.
- **Password Sharing:** Share passwords within teams and groups.
- **Public Viewing Links:** Generate a public link for a password with a restricted number of views.

## Use Case

For example, a company named XYZ can have the following structure:

- **Tech Team**
  - **Frontend Group**
    - API Access Keys
    - Stripe API Key
  - **Backend Group**
    - DB URI
    - AWS Credentials

In this way, different teams and groups within the company can manage and share their passwords securely using V-Pass.
